/* TEST BEFORE CONTINUING TO STAGE TWO! */

/* STAGE 1:ASK 5 QUESTIONS */


// Create a variable score, set to 0
// Write a for loop with question as the index, values 1 to 5
// Call askQuestion in the loop, with question as argument
// Add the returned value of askQuestion to score each time you call it (same line)
// return score after loop finishes

/* TEST BEFORE CONTINUING TO STAGE THREE! */

/* STAGE 3: MULTIPLE TRIES (CHALLENGE!) */

/* Refactor askQuestion per whileQuestions askFive calls askQuestion five times, counting and returning number wrong
 * Use the whileQuestions tab in the flowchart to guide you. 
 * @param: none
 * @return: score (0-5)
