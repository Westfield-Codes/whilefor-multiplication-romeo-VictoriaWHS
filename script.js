/* Setup */
// Define a function called main and then call it up top.
// Define a function called askFive and call it from inside main().
// Define a function called askQuestion and call it from inside askFive() as askQuestion(1);

/* STAGE 1:ASK A QUESTION */

/* askQuestion asks a multiplication question, returns 1 if incorrect
 * @param: question (integer 1-5)
 * @return: integer (0 or 1)
 */

/* STAGE 1:ASK 5 QUESTIONS */

/* askFive calls askQuestion five times, counting and returning number wrong
 * @param: none
 * @return: score (0-5)
 */

}
// Create a variable score, set to 0
// Write a for loop with question as the index, values 1 to 5
// Call askQuestion in the loop, with question as argument
// Add the returned value of askQuestion to score each time you call it (same line)
// return score after loop finishes

/* TEST BEFORE CONTINUING TO STAGE THREE! */

/* STAGE 3: MULTIPLE TRIES (CHALLENGE!) */

/* Refactor askQuestion per whileQuestions askFive calls askQuestion five times, counting and returning number wrong
 * Use the whileQuestions tab in the flowchart to guide you. 
 * @param: none
 * @return: score (0-5)
